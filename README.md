# UNLMTD - AI Recovery Tracker
A concept-stage AI-powered recovery tracker built during my AI
Entrepreneurship. This project was accepted into the **NSF I-Corps
competition**, where we iteratively refined our business model based
on real user research.

## ‚ùóThe Problem
Many athletes struggle with overtraining, burnout, and lack of
personalized recovery guidance. We found that while most fitness apps
focus on performance, few provide smart recovery planning to prevent
injury and support long-term health.

## üí°Our Idea
We designed an AI-based recovery tool that:
 - Integrates wearables to track biometric data (heart rate,
hydration, fatigue, sleep)
 - Generates personalized recovery plans
 - Visualizes progress over time
